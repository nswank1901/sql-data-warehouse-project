## Data Warehouse and Analytics Learning Project 

This repository is part of my SQL learning journey. The goal is to practice and understand how a data warehouse works — from designing tables to writing analytical queries. Rather than being a full production system, this project is focused on exploring the basics of data warehousing and analytics concepts through hands-on exercises.

### Project Overview

In this project, I’m learning about:

- Data Architecture: Setting up a simplified data warehouse design.

- ETL Concepts: Practicing how to extract, transform, and load data from CSV files into SQL    Server.

- Data Modeling: Building fact and dimension tables to support analysis.

- Analytics & Reporting: Writing SQL queries to generate insights from the data.

### Learning Objectives 

This project is helping me get comfortable with:

- SQL development and querying

- Basic data modeling (fact & dimension tables)

- Understanding ETL and data quality steps

- Practicing simple reporting and trend analysis in SQL

### Project Scope

Data Sources: Two CSV files representing ERP and CRM systems.

Integration: Combining these into a single data model.

Focus: Learning concepts rather than implementing a full historical/production-ready warehouse.

Documentation: Notes and explanations are included to reinforce what I’m learning along the way.
